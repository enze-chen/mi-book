    "There are many, _many_ Python tutorials out there, so **we've tried to make these exercises as relevant to MSE as possible**.\n",

    "After all, this whole internship is learning-driven and there are no grades.\n",

    "\n",
    "Arguably one of the most important properties in all of materials science is the [band gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap), which is a range of energies where no electronic states can exist.\n",
    "The band gap is formed in solids when many atoms are brought together into a close, periodic arrangement such that their orbitals hybridize into continuous energy bands where electrons are allowed to exist (see image in previous link).\n",
    "The lower band is called the **valence band** (electrons are bound to the atoms) and the upper band is called the **conduction band** (where electrons can flow to conduct current). \n",
    "The energy gap that separates these two bands (specifically, separating the valence band maximum (VBM) from the conduction band minimum (CBM)) is called the **band gap**, symbolized $E_g$.\n",
    "For more information, see Chapters 4.2-4.4 of the Kasap textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![band gap](../../assets/fig/week_1/01/band_gap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons have to overcome this gap in order to become a conducting electron, and so the band gap determines the conductivity of a solid.\n",
    "Some _approximate_ ranges for the band gap energy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $0 \\le E_g \\le 0.1\\ \\text{electronvolts (eV)}$, then the material is a **metal** (conductor), since electrons can very easily reach the conduction band. \n",
    "Example: copper (0.0 eV).\n",
    "- If $0.1 < E_g \\le\\ 4\\ \\text{eV}$, then the material is a **semiconductor**. \n",
    "Example: silicon (1.1. eV).\n",
    "- If $E_g > 4\\ \\text{eV}$, then the material is an **insulator**, since electrons will have a very hard time jumping from the valence band into the conduction band. \n",
    "In some (but not all) contexts, these materials are also referred to as **dielectrics**.\n",
    "Example: diamond (5 eV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a set of conditional statements that print out what type of material you have based on the value of `band_gap`.\n",

    "### OK back to the problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the previous steps to our current problem, we see that we should now be tackling the problem: \"How do I turn the file contents into a list of strings?\"\n",
    "If we can do this, then we can use what we know about lists and strings to \"read\" the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, there are many ways to read files in Python, and it all starts with _opening the file_.\n",
    "Like a book, you can't read a file if you don't open it.\n",
    "The _best way_ (safest, cleanest, recommended) to open files in Python is with the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    # do something with file object f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "- `with` is a handy keyword in Python that, among other things, ensures that our file is safely _closed_ after we're done with it.\n",
    "- `open()` is the built-in function to open a file.\n",
    "- `'path/to/file.txt'` is a string that represents the location of the file.\n",
    "    - `.txt` is the extension of text files. Your file may have a different extension.\n",
    "- `'r'` is a string that means \"read the file.\" Later we'll see that `'w'` _writes_ to a file.\n",
    "- `as` is another keyword for assiging aliases.\n",
    "- `f` is a variable for the **file object** that now represents our file in the computer memory.\n",
    "- Note that like `if` statements and `for` loops, the body for our file processing code is indented!\n",
    "\n",
    "OK! We're one step closer to our goal, because now we've loaded the file into memory.\n",
    "But note that `f` is the _file_, not necessarily its _contents_ (grr...), so we offer two solutions for accessing the contents of `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Load all lines into memory as a list of strings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    lines = f.readlines()\n",
    "    # do something with lines, such as a for loop through them\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Read the lines of the file one at a time\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    for i, line in enumerate(f):\n",
    "        # do something with each line, such as print it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1 works pretty well (it's exactly what we said we needed, haha), and we end up with a list that we can manipulate as we wish.\n",
    "One of the more significant drawbacks of this method is that it can be incredibly memory intensive if our file is very large.\n",
    "In Module 3, you will see files (from DFT) that are very large with hundreds of thousands of lines. üòÖ\n",
    "\n",

    "This is really key for you to understand what your variables and functions are doing, especially when you come back to the code the next day... or the next week... or the next year. üòÅ\n",
    "- **Practice decomposition**.\n",
    "By this we mean split your code into logical chunks, which may or may not go into helper functions, to help you organize your work.\n",
    "It's very easy with a language like Python to write _one giant script_ of hundreds of lines of code, which makes it very painful to read and debug (we've all been there).\n",
    "Decomposing your code makes it easier to test as you go and ensure sound logic.\n",
